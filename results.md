### Checkpoint sanity-check eval (`dreamerv3/eval.sh`, 50000 steps, GPU 0)

| Task | Metric | Result | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crafter | Crafter Score (`crafter_score.py`, achievement success rates) | **50.16%** over 22 achievements | `crafter_20260704_130112/20260704T223212F348053` |
| Atari Pong | `episode/score` mean, 16 episodes | **20.375** (min 19.0 / max 21.0) | `atari_pong_20260703_105122/20260704T103718F585051` |
| DMC Walker Walk | `episode/score` mean, 48 episodes | **962.4** (min 898.3 / max 990.3) | `dmc_walker_walk_20260706_113519/20260706T192124F187841` |

Crafter achievement breakdown: 100% on basic-tier (collect_wood/stone/drink/sapling,
place_table/stone/plant/furnace, make_wood_pickaxe/sword, wake_up), 89% collect_coal,
36% defeat_zombie, 37% eat_cow, 5% defeat_skeleton, 0.45% make_stone_pickaxe, and 0%
on the iron/diamond tier (collect_iron/diamond, make_stone_sword, make_iron_pickaxe/sword,
eat_plant) — model mastered the early tech tree but never progressed past it.

Compared against the published DreamerV3 curves bundled in `dreamerv3/scores/*.json.gz`:
- **Pong**: training stopped at step 18,784,560 (target was `5.1e7` in `configs.yaml`,
  likely cut short by the old TSUBAME 24h job limit) — but the eval score already sits in
  the paper's converged range (~20.3–20.8 across seeds at 200M frames), because Pong
  saturates early. **Converged, usable as-is.**
- **Walker Walk**: training completed essentially exactly at target
  (1,095,488 / 1.1e6 steps). Eval score matches the paper's 10-seed converged range
  (~887–991). **Fully converged, best-trained of the three.**
- **Crafter**: no step-count read done (config target `1.1e6`); score reflects a model
  that has NOT explored the deeper tech tree — usable, but imagined rollouts into
  iron/diamond-adjacent states should be treated as low-confidence (RSSM never trained
  on those transitions).

### `worldmodel_explain` pipeline smoke test

First real run of `method/worldmodel_explain/` against these 3 checkpoints.

Config used: `N=8` candidates, `T=30` horizon, `D={1,2,4,8}`, `fill=self_mean` (default
`global_prior` fill is not usable yet — needs offline rollout stats precomputed, see Open
Items below), `objective=H_sel` (`D_sel + λc·R(B)`, `λc=1.0`,
`β_dur=0.01, β_num=0.05, β_sep=0.01, β_dyn=0.05`), `search=greedy forward selection`.

| Task | J (8 candidates, unmasked) | B found | n_evals |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crafter | `[7.004, 6.780, 8.817, 7.633, 7.150, 6.424, 7.494, 6.999]` | `[(4,11), (0,3)]` | 325 |
| Atari Pong | `[2.954, 2.949, 2.979, 2.920, 2.966, 2.908, 2.902, 2.989]` | `[]` (empty) | 110 |
| DMC Walker Walk | `[313.9, 313.9, 320.2, 313.2, 320.8, 315.2, 313.1, 322.5]` | `[]` (empty) | 110 |

This is effectively a check of whether `self_mean` fill forces real work out of the
search. **Crafter passed** (candidates well-separated, J range 6.4–8.8; masking flipped
the argmax, `D_sel(∅)=1`, so search added `[(4,11), (0,3)]` back in). **Pong/Walker
Walk did not** (candidate J's packed within ~0.03–0.09 of each other; even fully-masked
`self_mean` reproduced the original argmax, `D_sel(∅)=0`, so `H_sel(∅)=0` was already the
minimum and search stopped at `B=∅`) — this is the intended §8 sanity check working
correctly, not a pipeline bug: these two decision points just weren't decisive enough.

**Conclusion**: all 3 checkpoints are usable as trained world models for this method —
rollout, scoring, and search all behave sensibly, including correctly flagging the
degenerate `B=∅` cases.

Note: this Crafter run and the §8 diagnostic-experiment Crafter run below sampled
different decision points (different J vectors on the same checkpoint) — decision-point
sampling isn't currently reproducible run-to-run, see Open items.

### §8 diagnostic experiments — first full run, all 3 tasks in parallel (GPU 0/1/3)

Ran all four `method/worldmodel_explain/experiments/*.py` scripts (readme.md §8.1-8.4)
for all three checkpoints in parallel (one GPU each), `fill=self_mean` (per-task config
copies under `worldmodel_explain/config_<task>.yaml`, since `global_prior` still isn't
implemented). Full logs + PNGs under `experiments/out/<task>/`.

**8.1 B=∅ sanity check** (`self_mean`/`shuffle`/`zero` fills, single decision point each):

| Task | self_mean D_sel/D_rank/D_margin | shuffle | zero | Suspect fills? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crafter | 0.000 / 0.250 / 0.924 | 1.000 / 0.357 / 1.455 | 1.000 / 0.571 / 1.945 | none |
| Atari Pong | 0.000 / 0.000 / 0.083 | 0.000 / 0.179 / 0.554 | 0.000 / 0.000 / 0.083 | **all 3** |
| DMC Walker Walk | 1.000 / 0.036 / 0.160 | 1.000 / 0.750 / 4.060 | 0.000 / 0.036 / 0.163 | **zero** |

**Conclusion**: Pong's decision point is degenerate across all three fills (can't
demonstrate the method here). Walker Walk's `zero` fill leaks (consistent with
readme.md §3's known risk); `self_mean`/`shuffle` behave correctly. Crafter: none
flagged.

**8.2 Cross-baseline agreement** (IoU of B across fill strategies, `H_sel`):

| Crafter | Atari Pong | DMC Walker Walk |
|---|---|---|
| ![Crafter cross-baseline agreement](images/crafter/cross_baseline_agreement.png) | ![Pong cross-baseline agreement](images/atari_pong/cross_baseline_agreement.png) | ![Walker Walk cross-baseline agreement](images/dmc_walker_walk/cross_baseline_agreement.png) |

**Conclusion**: Crafter's fills disagree (`self_mean` |B|=0, `shuffle` |B|=1, `zero`
|B|=4 covering the full horizon) — `zero` is the outlier/leaking, not evidence the
method itself is unstable. Pong's "agreement" (all `B=∅`) and Walker Walk's partial
agreement (`self_mean`/`zero` empty, `shuffle` 2/30 covered) are both downstream of the
degenerate-decision-point issue, not genuine cross-baseline robustness.

**8.3 Cross-objective agreement** (`B_sel` vs `B_rank` vs `B_margin`, `self_mean` fill):

| Crafter | Atari Pong | DMC Walker Walk |
|---|---|---|
| ![Crafter cross-objective agreement](images/crafter/cross_objective_agreement.png) | ![Pong cross-objective agreement](images/atari_pong/cross_objective_agreement.png) | ![Walker Walk cross-objective agreement](images/dmc_walker_walk/cross_objective_agreement.png) |

**Conclusion**: Crafter confirms readme.md §5's design assumption — `sel`/`rank`/`margin`
point at genuinely different evidence (`sel=[(9,12)]`, `rank=[]`,
`margin=[(2,9),(13,14),(0,1)]`, pairwise IoU 0.00–0.07). Pong/Walker Walk mostly
collapse to empty/near-identical B across objectives, again downstream of the
degenerate-decision-point issue rather than the objectives being redundant.

**8.4 Cost accounting**: cheap across the board — 0.08-0.79s and 110-743 `G` evaluations
per (fill, objective) combo, all three tasks. `H_margin`/`shuffle` combos are consistently
the most expensive (more segments end up retained → more evals before greedy stops); `sel`
+ `self_mean`/`zero` are the cheapest. No scalability concern at this N=8/T=30 scale.

### Open items (carried over from readme.md §9, still unresolved)

- `global_prior` fill needs an offline-rollout precompute step (`config.yaml`
  `masking.global_prior.rollouts_dir` is empty) — not implemented yet.
- `H_full` and `counterfactual_reimagine` still haven't been exercised by any experiment
  script.
- **Pong and Walker Walk's sampled decision point is degenerate** (candidate J's within
  ~0.03-0.16 of each other) and makes the method's output trivial (`B=∅` or near-empty)
  for most fill/objective combos — this is a decision-point-sampling issue, not a model
  or pipeline bug (Crafter's decision point, by contrast, produced clearly non-trivial,
  differentiated B's across objectives). Next step: sample multiple decision points per
  task (raise `get_decision_point`'s `warmup_steps`, or loop it) and pick/report on ones
  where candidates actually disagree, rather than judging the method on one arbitrary
  frame per task.
- **Decision-point sampling isn't reproducible run-to-run**: the Crafter smoke test and
  the Crafter §8 diagnostic run above used the same checkpoint/config/seed but landed on
  different decision points (different J vectors) — needs investigation before results
  from separate runs can be compared directly.

*Tip: decision-point sampling (env reset + policy action sampling) is now
seeded and verified reproducible — the same `(seed, step)` always yields the
same imagined rollout and `J`, for all three tasks.*

### Multi-point sampling sweep (`fill=self_mean`, `objective=H_sel`, 35 points/task)

5 env seeds × 7 steps (1/5/10/15/20/25/30) = 35 decision points per task.
Per point: `J range` = max−min candidate score ("how decisive is this
point"), and whether greedy search finds any evidence at all (`B` non-empty).

| Task | Max J range found | Non-empty `B` rate | Reference point |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crafter | 5.72 | 20/35 (57%) | seed=3, step=25 |
| Atari Pong | 0.10 | 11/35 (31%) | seed=2, step=30 |
| DMC Walker Walk | 18.32 | 8/35 (23%) | seed=0, step=25 |

**Conclusions:**

- **Walker Walk is not a degenerate task** (J range up to 18.3 — an order of
  magnitude above the single arbitrary point checked on 2026-07-14), but
  `self_mean` fails *worse* the more decisive the point: all 5 top points by
  J range give `B=∅`; every non-empty `B` in the whole sweep comes from a
  point with J range < 3.5. This is `self_mean`'s self-leakage failure mode
  (readme.md §3) — masking with a trajectory's own mean reconstructs a
  sustained, global signal like Walker Walk's average-velocity return, and
  does so *better* the larger that signal is.
- **Pong's low decisiveness is real** (max J range 0.10 across all 35
  points, uniformly small) — consistent with its near-ceiling eval score,
  not a fill or sampling artifact.
- **Crafter**: `self_mean` works reasonably well (57%), with no such inverse
  relationship between decisiveness and `B` size.

### Fill × objective grid, all 35 decision points per task

Comprehensive version of the diagnostic above: is `self_mean`'s weakness
specific to that one (fill, objective) pair, or does it hold for the other
fills (`shuffle`, `zero`, and — once built, see below — `global_prior`) and
the other two objectives (`H_rank`, `H_margin`)? All 4×3 fill/objective
combinations evaluated on *all 35* decision points per task (not just the
most decisive few — `experiments/fill_objective_sweep.py --top-k 1000`).
`global_prior` uses population-level per-timestep means for `{r, u, d}`,
estimated from ~1000 sampled imagined candidates per task
(`experiments/build_global_prior.py`, saved to
`worldmodel_explain/priors/<task>/prior.npz`, closing the readme.md §9 open
item). Cell = % of the 35 points where greedy search returns a non-empty `B`:

**Crafter**

| fill | H_sel | H_rank | H_margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| self_mean | 54% | 80% | 94% |
| shuffle | 66% | 94% | 97% |
| zero | 71% | 100% | 100% |
| global_prior | 80% | 100% | 97% |

**Atari Pong**

| fill | H_sel | H_rank | H_margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| self_mean | 31% | 46% | 51% |
| shuffle | 66% | 94% | 100% |
| zero | 31% | 46% | 51% |
| global_prior | 94% | 100% | 100% |

**DMC Walker Walk**

| fill | H_sel | H_rank | H_margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| self_mean | 23% | 34% | 80% |
| shuffle | 54% | 91% | 100% |
| zero | 54% | 57% | 94% |
| global_prior | 83% | 100% | 100% |

*(`shuffle`'s numbers move a few points between re-runs — it draws an
unseeded random permutation each call; doesn't change any conclusion below.)*

**Conclusions:**

1. **`global_prior` is the best fill overall, on every task and every
   objective** (`H_sel` 80–94%, `H_rank` 100%, `H_margin` 97–100%) — it fixes
   `self_mean`'s self-leakage failure (readme.md §3): the replacement value
   for a masked step no longer depends on that candidate's own magnitude, so
   it can't "leak" the answer for free.
2. **`global_prior`'s `H_rank` initially measured 0% on every task — a
   metric bug, now fixed.** Fully masking with `global_prior` collapses all 8
   candidates' scores to the *same* value (e.g. `J̃ = [5.838, 5.838, ...]`),
   leaving no pair of candidates to compare. `objectives.d_rank`'s
   Kendall-tau used to default to τ=1 ("ranking preserved") whenever there
   were zero comparable pairs, so a fully-collapsed, uninformative ranking
   scored identically to a perfectly-preserved one and greedy search never
   had a reason to add anything back. Fixed by defaulting to τ=-1
   (worst case) instead — the table above already reflects the fix. Only
   candidate-independent fills ever hit this (`self_mean`/`shuffle`/`zero`
   keep per-candidate structure at `B=∅` and don't).
3. **`self_mean` is the weakest fill on every task/objective**, and
   specifically fails worse the more decisive the point is on Walker Walk:
   restricting to just its 5 most decisive points (J range 7.5–18.3) drops
   its `H_sel` rate to 0% (vs. 23% pooled over all 35) — direct evidence the
   self-leakage effect scales with how much of the signal is a sustained,
   global quantity (Walker Walk's return ≈ average velocity) rather than a
   local event.
4. **`self_mean` and `zero` behave identically on Pong** (identical rates in
   every cell) — Pong's reward is sparse/near-zero at most steps, so masking
   it to zero and masking it to its own mean converge.

**Practical takeaway**: `global_prior` should be the default fill across all
three objectives (already set in the task configs) — it's no longer just the
`H_sel`/`H_margin` recommendation, the `H_rank` weakness was a measurement
artifact, not a real limitation.

### Cross-objective agreement (readme.md §5's planned comparison), `global_prior`, reference points

For each task's reference decision point, ran `H_sel`/`H_rank`/`H_margin`
independently with `global_prior` fill (`experiments/cross_objective_agreement.py`)
and compared the resulting `B`s:

| Task | `B_sel` | `B_rank` | `B_margin` | sel↔rank | sel↔margin | rank↔margin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crafter | `[(29,29)]` | `[(15,16),(17,20)]` | `[(0,7),(8,15),(15,22),(22,29)]` | 0.00 | 0.03 | 0.20 |
| Atari Pong | `[(7,7)]` | `[(7,7)]` | `[(0,0),(1,8),(9,16),(14,21),(22,29)]` | 1.00 | 0.03 | 0.03 |
| DMC Walker Walk | `[]` | `[(28,29)]` | `[(0,7),(6,13),(14,21),(22,29)]` | — | — | 0.07 |

Timelines: `images/{crafter,atari_pong,dmc_walker_walk}/cross_objective_agreement.png`.

**Conclusions:**

1. **Confirms readme.md §5's expected size ordering** (`|B_sel| ≤ |B_rank| ≤
   |B_margin|`) on all three tasks — `H_margin` needs evidence covering
   almost the entire 30-step horizon, `H_sel` needs at most one single-step
   segment.
2. **The three objectives mostly surface different evidence** (IoU 0.00–0.20
   in 5 of 6 comparisons) — consistent with the 2026-07-14 finding that
   `sel`/`rank`/`margin` answer genuinely different questions, not a nested
   "bigger B contains the smaller ones" relationship.
3. **Exception**: Pong's `B_sel` and `B_rank` are *identical* (`[(7,7)]`,
   IoU=1.0) — at this point, whatever single segment justifies the top pick
   also fully explains the entire ranking. A real, task-specific result, not
   the general pattern (the other two tasks show near-zero sel↔rank overlap).
4. **Walker Walk's `B_sel` is empty at its reference point** — this is one of
   the ~20% of points where `global_prior`'s `H_sel` is already trivially
   satisfied at `B=∅` (matches the earlier sanity-check flag for this same
   point). Not a useful point for an `H_sel` case study on this task; a
   different point from the 35-point sweep should be picked if one is needed.

### Open items (updated)

- ~~Decision-point sampling isn't reproducible run-to-run~~ — **resolved**.
- ~~Pong and Walker Walk's sampled decision point is degenerate~~ — **resolved
  for Walker Walk** (it isn't degenerate; `self_mean` leakage was masking
  that). **Still true for Pong**, confirmed to be a property of the
  task/checkpoint rather than a sampling issue.
- ~~`global_prior` fill needs an offline-rollout precompute step~~ —
  **resolved**, see "Fill × objective grid, all 35 decision points per task" above.
- ~~`D_rank`'s tie-breaking makes it structurally blind to candidate-independent
  fills like `global_prior`~~ — **resolved**, see conclusion 2 above.
- ~~Cross-objective agreement hasn't been re-run against the new reference
  points / `global_prior`~~ — **resolved**, see "Cross-objective agreement" above.
- `H_full` and `counterfactual_reimagine` still haven't been exercised by any experiment
  script.
- `cross_baseline_agreement.py`'s heatmap and the §8 cost-accounting experiment
  haven't been re-run against the new reference points / `global_prior` yet
  (the numeric substance of a baseline comparison is already covered by the
  fill × objective grid above, just not as a heatmap image).
- `shuffle`'s fill is unseeded (fresh RNG per call, see note above) — low
  priority (doesn't change conclusions) but worth seeding if exact numbers
  need to match run-to-run.
